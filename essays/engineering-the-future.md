## My Interests

As a computer science student for the past two years, I have been exposed to a lot of different aspects of coding and the world of developing software. Previously, I had thought that computer science meant either coding or cyber security. However, I quickly realized the many different aspects and interests that are encompassed in computer science. Whether it is game development, algorithms, grey-hat hacking, data science, or software engineering, there is a place for most everything. Personally, I enjoy the aspects of coding that relate directly to the human user. Game design, web design, and Aerospace systems have intrigued me since the code has a direct impact on human performance.

As a pilot, I understand the importance of crew resource management and task completion in the cockpit. And although I've never flown anything besides light aircraft, where all flight controls are manually activated, I look forward to having a career flying aircraft with automation. Understanding the importance of things such as flap levels or spoiler deployment, I am highly interested in how those functions have been automated to reduce pilot workload. Code that can be applied in such a way fascinates me, and whether I have a career as a pilot or as a software developer, that knowledge could definitely help me.

## Skills for the Future

Because I am so interested in software that directly impacts infrastructure, machines, and the daily lives of people, I think that my focus as a software engineering student is on developing the skills necessary to enhance human performance. Reducing workload is a common approach to do this, and artificial intelligence is what is needed to replace the human element for some tasks. I am very interested in developing skills in AI, machine learning, and other types of software that can be used in the real world.

I have always enjoyed being a hands-on, outdoors kind of person. If I ever work as a software developer, I want to be on the front line, testing and observing how my code works. It's a little satisfying to spend days on a program and be rewarded with a correct output in the console. But I want to learn the skills necessary to be out in the field experimenting with my code. Whether I'm automating airplanes or helping design a robot with machine learning, I hope to gain the knowledge and skills that will help me to make a direct impact on the world with my software.
