Encampment is a week-long training activity that serves as a basic training for Civil Air Patrol cadets across the nation. As the Cadet Commander, I served for a four month period planning, organizing and executing the activity as the senior cadet responsible for nearly 150 other cadet staff and students. 

This Encampment was the first year of a historic partnership between Oregon and Alaska, and my job necessitated laying the groundwork for a new system of cooperation. A restructing of the curriculum and operations plan were necessary, and needed to be fit into a smaller time frame. I organized my staff and produced an effective plan that resulted in a successful activity and graduation for 100 new cadet leaders from all over the United States.
